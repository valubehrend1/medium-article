            <h3>The Hidden Structure of a Square</h3>
            <p>
                Cut a disk out of dark cardboard and place it on a white square in the position indicated by Figure r.
                The location of the disk could be determined and described by measurement. A yardstick would tell in
                inches
                the distances from the disk to the
                edges of the square. Thus it could be inferred that the disk lies off-center.
            </p>
            <p>
                This result would come as no surprise. We do not have to measure-we
                saw at a glance that the disk lies off-center. How is such "seeing" done? Did
                we behave like a yardstick by first looking at the space between the disk and
                the left edge and then carrying our image of that distance across to the other
                side to compare the two distances? Probably not. It would not be the most
                efficient procedure.
                Looking at Figure r as a whole, we probably noticed the asymmetrical
                position of the disk as a visual property of the pattern.
                We did not see disk
                and square separately. Their spatial relation within the whole is part of what
                we see. Such relational observations are an indispensable aspect of common
                experience in many sensory areas. "My right hand is larger than the left."
                "This flagpole is not straight." "That piano is out of tune."
            </p>
            <h4><em>"This cocoa is sweeter than the kind we had before."</em></h4>
            <p>
                Objects are perceived immediately as having a certain size, that is, as
                lying somewhere between a grain of salt and a mountain. On the scale of
                brightness values, our white square lies high, our black disk low. Similarly,
                every object is seen as having a location. The book you are reading appears
                at a particular spot, which is defined by the room about you and the objects
                in it-among them notably you yourself. The square of Figure 1 appears
                somewhere on the book page, and the disk is off-center in the square. No
                object is perceived as unique or isolated. Seeing something involves assigning
                it a place in the whole: a location in space, a score on the scale of size or
                brightness or distance.

            <h3>Right and Left</h3>
            <p>
                The anisotropy of physical space makes us distinguish between top and
                bottom but less so between left and right. A violin standing upright looks
                more symmetrical than one lying on its side. Man and animal are sufficiently
                bilateral creatures to have trouble in telling left from right, b from d. Corballis
                and Beale have argued that such a symmetrical response is biologically advantageous so long as nervous
                systems are focused on movement and orientation in a world in which attack or reward are equally likely
                from either side.
                However, as soon as man learned to use tools that are better operated by
                one hand than by two, asymmetrical-handedness became an asset; and when
                sequential thought began to be recorded in linear writing, one lateral direction
                came to dominate the other. In the words of Goethe: "The more perfect the
                creature, the more dissimilar its parts get to be."
                Visually, lateral asymmetry manifests itself in an uneven distribution of
                weight and in a dynamic vector leading from the left to the right of the visual
                field. The phenomenon is unlikely to be noticeable in strictly symmetrical
                patterns, e.g., the faade of a building, but it is quite effective in paintings. The
                art historian Heinrich Wolffiin has pointed out that pictures change appearance and lose meaning when
                turned into their mirror images
